		<h2>Mission Impossible:Fallout:-</h2>
		<p>The 6th instalment of the mission impossible franchise is the best action movie I have seen in many years. Its breathtaking action sequences are meticulously crafted and will leave you on the edge of your seat. This franchise is known for its epic action scenes and this movie takes it to a whole new level and the fact that Tom Cruise performed his own stunts makes those scenes even more thrilling and exciting. Even though the plot might seem similar to the previous films it is handled brilliantly with many twists, turns, and double-crossings which keeps you interested in the story in-between the action sequences.</p>

		<h2>1917:-</h2>
		<p>I am a big fan of Sam Mendes's James bond movies Skyfall and Spectre. So I was very excited to see this movie. The most amazing aspect of this movie is its excellent cinematography by the genius oscar-winning cinematographer Roger Deakins. The scenes in this movie are beautifully framed and are a delight to watch. The movie is also filmed and edited in such a way to make it appear as a single long continuous shot which has never been done before in a war film. It is a technological achievement.
        It is thrilling, tense, suspenseful and the background score escalates the experience.</p>

		<h2>Joker:-</h2>
		<p>I am a big fan of Nolan's joker(The Dark Knight). So when I heard that a stand-alone joker movie is going to come up I was very excited. This movie is amazing. It is dark and gritty in a beautiful way.
        The cinematography is excellent. What I found most impressive is the soundtrack by the now Oscar winner Hildur Guðnadóttir. The background score totally elevates the intensity of the scenes. The bathroom dance scene is really a work of art. Joaquin Pheonix's performance was outstanding and he completely deserved an Oscar for it.
        This movie doesn't glorify violence. It might seem like it does. It actually gives us the perspective of a person who commits violent acts. This movie is not justifying violence and murder, it's just telling us how society sometimes pushes people to their tipping point and perform violent acts. It is teaching us the importance of mental health.</p>

		<h2>Dark</h2>
		<p>What starts off as a familiar premise soon turns into a big sci-fi thriller mystery which spans across many generations creating a complex story which needs your full attention and brainpower to completely appreciate its genius. The writers of this show created something very ambitions and mind-boggling and deserve praise and recognition.
        The cinematography is beautiful. The shots of the town Winden are very beautifully framed.
        The background score is scary and mysterious.
        What I liked about this series is that you need to put some effort into understanding the story which in turn rewards you by revealing the truths and connecting all lose-ends as you reach the epic finale. The ending is emotional and satisfying.</p>
